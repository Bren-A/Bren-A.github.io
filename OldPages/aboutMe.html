	<!-- About Me spiel yada yada -->
	<p>
		My name is Brendan Alger. I am currently a Linguistics & Computer Science student at UCLA. 
		<br/><br/>
		Similar to this site, it may not look like much but I'm more than meets the HTML (by more I mean I make more punny jokes...)
		Anyways, I will keep trying my best to improve the look and feel of this site. If anyone has any tips/suggestions, let me know! I am always looking to improve the site.
