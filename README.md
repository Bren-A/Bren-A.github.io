# Bren-A.github.io

This is the repository of a site I'm currently working on to put everything onto.

## Programming Languages used to make this

Just HTML and CSS as of now. I want to make as much as I can with these two before
I begin to add some Javascript.
Git as version control (Don't want anything bad to happen to the real site!!)
