# Bren-A.github.io

This is the repository of a site I'm currently working on to put everything onto.

## Programming Languages used to make this

Well, only HTML as of now
Git as version control (Don't want anything bad to happen to the real site!!)

## Random Stuff
I used bash to automate the push/ making a branch stuff. I'm a slow typer and it annoyed me to keep typing the same commmands with variations(i.e. I coudldn't just use the command history!! :( )
