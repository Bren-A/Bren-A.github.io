                <p>
                My name is Brendan and I am a programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a 
                Bachelors in Linguistics and Computer Science in 2019. I love learning and 
                constantly make an effort to find and embrace new challenges and responsibilities. 
                I pay great attention to detail, as exemplified in my work in which I implement innovation and 
                effectiveness at the highest standard of technical excellence that I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of programming,
                I am an avid maker and love crafting and doing things with my own hands. I have a variety of 
                interests from origami to classic car restoration which you can find on my blogs.
                </p>
                <p>
                On this page you will find some links to access information about me and some of my side 
                projects/hobbies. Feel free to look around!!
