	<p>
	My name is Brendan and I am a programmer.
	</p>
	<p>
	I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a 
	Bachelors in Linguistics and Computer Science due to my interest in both languages
	and technology. I love learning, which is why I constantly make an effort to find and embrace 
	new challenges and responsibilities (such as building this website). I pay great attention to 
	detail, as exemplified in my work in which I implement innovation and 
	effectiveness at the highest standard of technical excellence that I can.
	</p>
	<p>
	I bring this work ethic with me to every scenario that I encounter. Outside of programming,
	I am an avid maker and love crafting and doing things with my own hands. I have a variety of 
	interests from origami to classic car restoration.
