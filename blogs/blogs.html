		<!-- Quick Description of what my blogs are about -->
		<p>
			Some writeups on projects I did in the past.<br><br>
			I'm not usually someone who documents my work; when I start a project I tend to get very focused and forget to record my progress. This is my attempt at doing the opposite of that.

		<h2>Car Restoration</h2>
		<p>
			I have a car. It's old. It's 10 years older than me to be exact. So I've begun restoring it to its former glory.<br><br>
			Along with some more modern touches, of course.<br><br>
			It's a 5 speed BMW E30 325i Cabriolet. <br>

			Projects coming soon!!
<!--			I like clothes, and sometimes I find a really nice piece of clothing that's way outside my budget. So I try and make piece in a similar design; sometimes with a different color or cut.
