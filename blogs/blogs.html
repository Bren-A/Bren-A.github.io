		<!-- Quick Description of what my blogs are about -->
		<p>
			These are some writeups about projects I've worked on in the past. This includes my projects, hobbies, and other things that I enjoy doing for fun.<br>
			I'm not usually someone who documents my work; when I start a project I tend to get very focused and forget to record my progress. This is my attempt at doing the opposite of that.

		<!-- Website Blog -->
		<h2>Website</h2>
		<p>
			This will be where I write random things about making this site.<br>
			I tried to do this before and I wasn't consistent enough. Hopefully I can do a better job this time.

		<h2>Car Restoration</h2>
		<p>
			I have a car. It's old. As in 10 years older than me to be exact. <br>
			It's a 5 speed BMW E30 325i Cabriolet; it's the first car I ever owned. Teenage me wasn't impressed with the car and HATED that it was manual. Needles to say I didn't take care of it much. But over time it grew on me and now I really like it. So I've begun restoring it to its former glory.<br>
			Along with some more modern touches, of course.

		<h2>Sewing</h2>
		<p>
			I like clothes, and sometimes I find a really nice piece of clothing that's way outside my budget. So I try and make piece in a similar design; sometimes with a different color or cut.
