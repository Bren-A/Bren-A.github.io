	<h2>Fixing plastic parts by hand(PICTURES COMING SOON)</h2>
	<p>
		When I began <a href = "../../oops.jpg">working on the interior</a>, I noticed the ashtrays were worse for wear. The plastic had been destroyed from years of use. It had cracks everywhere. The hole on the side where the hinge mechanism fits into broke off so the cover didn't stay in place, and the lip that borders the opening had snapped off as well <br>
		
		I was looking to buy a replacement but after some quick online shopping, I learned that ashtrays are EXPENSIVE. (Note: This is also when I realized that the cars of a "Car Guy" runs on money instead of gas) <br>
		
		So instead of dropping an unreasonable amount of money on an ashtray, I decided to try and fix the parts myself. But I don't know how to work with plastic. Most instructional videos I found online only demonstrated small repairs such as cracked or chipped plastic; and anything more complex than that required me to make a mold. <br>

		I thought about using a filler and sanding it to shape, but filler is liquid and wouldn't stay on. The only way for it to stick was to use a lot, which meant a lot of sanding and a lot of wasted product. <br>

		I was thinking of biting the bullet and just spending the money on an ashtray, until I stumbled upon videos of people modifying the shapes of rubiks cubes.<br>

		After binging on a few videos, I discovered that many people used a product called milliput, which is a form of epoxy putty. It's it's like a clay version of filler.<br>

		However I didn't end up using milliput. I went with apoxie sculpt, which is another brand epoxy putty used by sculptors and model makers. It comes in larger quantities than milliput and is eligible for prime (It was $20 for a pound of it). Downside is that it only comes in larger amounts and has one color; which is like a pale grey. So for those who only need a little or are against painting, milliput is an equivalent option.<br>

		The product comes in 2 parts. Mixing the two parts will activate the product and will allow it to harden over time. You mix each part equally, so what I did was estimate how much I'd need and then divided that in half, taking that amount from each container. <br>

		I then molded it to get a rough idea of what it should look like. It's not difficult to use. basically as if you're sculpting using regular clay. I added a bit more than I needed so that I can sand it down and make a more precise and smooth final piece.<br>

		<!-- Image of sanding -->
		I sanded down the excess, shaping it with a dremel. The original plastic also has a bit of a texture. I didn't bother recreating the texture, so I just sanded the whole thing down to make it all smooth. I you want to keep the texture, it's a bumpy texture you can probably mimic by lightly dabbing black paint on the surface or specifically buying paint that has a bumpy texture. <br>

		<!-- Yay! Sanding done! -->
		Finished sanding. Looks good!<br>

		<!-- Painted!! -->
		All that's left is to paint it black. I used some simple 2 in 1 spraypaint to make it black. It's a small piece in the interior so I wasn't too worried about it being perfect, and since it's not as exposed to the elements as the outside, I didn't invest too much time into the paint. <br>

		<!-- Finally putting it in ;p) -->

		And viola! There it is. My sculpting skills aren't the best, but looking without scrutiny the difference is unnoticeable. Overall I'm happy with the outcome. I will probably use this to fix other plasic parts that might need fixing. More pics of that coming soon!
