	<h1> Making a reddit bot using python </h1>
	
	<div id = Overview>
	<p>
		I came up with an idea to create a reddit bot that messages the user about new posts that contain a specific keyword provided by the user. For example, there is a subreddit /r/frugalmalefashion where users make posts about deals on clothing. If I was looking to buy some boots and didn't want to constantly check the subreddit for deals, I would activate the bot and have it message me every time there was a new post that contained the word "boot" in the title.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Initially, I have broken down the process to these steps:<br>
		<ol>
			<li> Get information from /r/frugalmalefashion and filter it </li>
			<li> Enable the bot to interact with reddit users</li>
			<li> Have the bot run online </li>
			<li> Use a Rasberry Pi to enable the bot to run 24/7 </li>
			<li> Expand the abilitites of the bot to run on more than 1 subreddit </li>
		</ol>
	</p>
