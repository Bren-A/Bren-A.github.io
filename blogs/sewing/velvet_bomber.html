	<h2>Velvet Bomber</h2>
	<p>
		Ever since I saw it, I thought it looked amazing.
	</p>

	<h3>Design</h3>
	<p>
		The jacket is very intricate, and to be honest my patternmaking skills aren't up to snuff to recreate the piece exactly. But there are a few key features I'd like to recreate:
			<h4>Gathered Sleeves</h4>
			<p>
				The gathered sleeve is a feature I've noticed in many bomber jackets. And this jacket is no exception. Another interesting fact to note is that there is no seam at the front of the jacket, and rather the front part of the sleeve continues and is part of the top third of the jacket.
			</p>

			<h4> Action Back Shoulder plate</h4>
			<p>
				This jacket has a feature I don't see often in newer clothes. The back of the jacket has pleated shoulders
