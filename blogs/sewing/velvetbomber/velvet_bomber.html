	<h2>Velvet Bomber</h2>
	<p>
		Ever since I saw it, I thought it looked amazing. At first glance what pops out is the fabric. A rich red velvet all over with maroon cuffs. Detailed with metal zippers and fasteners, and the way the pieces are put together add an additional layer of detailing to the jacket. I immediately wanted to get one for myself, but there was an issue: it was sold out everywhere and the asking price for a <i>used</i> jacket reached highs of <b>$4,000 dollars</b>. And yes, I didn't put a decimal there. Needless to say, if I wanted one either I'd start saving up for a used car or make it myself. <br>

		I am using an online listing of the jacket to gather information on its design. <br>
		The jacket is very intricate. The longer I look at it, the more detailed it becomes. <br>

		To be honest, my patternmaking skills aren't up to snuff to perfectly recreate the piece. There are small details everywhere in the piece that will take a lot of trial and error to create. <br>

		There are two main parts that I forsee being a patternmaking challenge:
		<ul>
			<li><h4>Gathered Sleeves</h4>
			<p>
				The gathered sleeve is a feature I've noticed in many bomber jackets. This jacket has slighlty elongated sleeves that are gathered near the elbow area, giving it a draped appeareance <br>

			</p></li>

			<li><h4> Pleated Shoulder Plate</h4>
			<p>
				This jacket has a feature I don't see often. The back of the jacket has pleats on its shoulders, which is a type of "Action Back" design I usually find in older or more utilitaraian garments to increase movement. <br>

	<h3>Making the pattern</h3>
	<p>
		I was lucky to have a jacket at home that had a similar cut and fit to what I was looking for. It's an old leather bomber jacket. It has a boxy cut and the shoulders were patterned into two pieces, making the pleated shoulders easier to make.<br>

		<!-- Use black leather jacket -->

		The jacket is described as having "kimono sleeves". I've had experience making traditional Japanese inspired garments, and they are very simple to make since the garments lie flat and the pieces are very angular(i.e LOTS of straight lines). <br>

		I decided to use that as a basis for making the pattern. I only used the jacket to make measurements and to copy the shapes of any curves. Referencing the picture of the sleeves, you can see the front of the sleeves actually connect to the chest, with no seam between.
