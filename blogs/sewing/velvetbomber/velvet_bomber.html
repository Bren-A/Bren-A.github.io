	<h2>Velvet Bomber</h2>
	<p>
		Ever since I saw it, I thought it looked amazing. At first glance what pops out is the fabric. A rich red velvet all over with maroon cuffs. Detailed with metal zippers and fasteners, and the way the pieces are put together add an additional layer of detailing to the jacket. I immediately wanted to get one for myself, but there was an issue: it was sold out everywhere and the asking price for a <i>used</i> jacket reached highs of <b>$4,000 dollars</b>. And yes, I didn't put a decimal there. Needless to say, if I wanted one either I'd start saving up for a used car or make it myself. <br>

		I am using an online listing of the jacket to gather information on its design. <br>
		The jacket is very intricate. The longer I look at it, the more detailed it becomes. <br>

		To be honest, my patternmaking skills aren't up to snuff to perfectly recreate the piece. There are small details everywhere in the piece that will take a lot of trial and error to create. <br>

		There are two main parts that I forsee being a patternmaking challenge:
		<ul>
			<li><h4>Gathered Sleeves</h4>
			<p>
				The gathered sleeve is a feature I've noticed in many bomber jackets. And this jacket is no exception. Another interesting fact to note is that there is no seam at the front of the jacket, and rather the front part of the sleeve continues and is part of the top third of the jacket. <br>

			</p></li>

			<li><h4> Pleated Shoulder Plate</h4>
			<p>
				This jacket has a feature I don't see often. The back of the jacket has pleats on its shoulders, which is a type of "Action Back" design usually found in older jackets meant to increase movement. <br>

		</ul>
		<br>
		The most daunting task that I can see before even starting is the sleeves. How will I pattern the piece and how will I sew it all together?

	<h3>Making the pattern</h3>
	<p>
		I was lucky to have a jacket at home that had a similar cut to what I was looking for. Even better, it had a boxy cut <b>and</b> pleated shoulder plates.
