			<p>
			My name is Brendan and I am a programmer.
			</p>
			<p>
			I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a 
			Bachelors in Linguistics and Computer Science due to my interest in both languages
			and technology. I love learning, which is why I constantly make an effort to find and embrace 
			new challenges and responsibilities (such as building this website). I pay great attention to 
			detail, as exemplified in my work in which I implement innovation and 
			effectiveness at the highest standard of technical excellence that I can.
			</p>
			<p>
			I bring this work ethic with me to every scenario that I encounter. Outside of programming,
			I am an avid maker and love crafting and doing things with my own hands. I have a variety of 
			interests from origami to classic car restoration.
