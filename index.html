			My name is Brendan, and welcome to my site!

			Here you will find an assortment of information about me, such as my resume, past projects I've done, and other things as well.

			It may look different from the last time you saw it(hint: All the CSS and most of the pages are gone!) <br>
			I messed up when I was pushing the site onto github. I was always told by professors to backup my work, but now I really learned that lesson. <br>
			Luckily this gives me a blank canvas to redo the site. And anyways, there was an issue with scaling, which I want to do right this time.
